## Honolulu SQLAlchemy Challenge Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a SQL database to manage employee data for Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. The database is populated with data from CSV files representing employee information from the 1980s and 1990s. The project includes data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. You're challenge is to combine the powers of SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Matplotlib to complete your weather analysis.
